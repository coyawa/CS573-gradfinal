### Abstract:
The journalism is growing with a very high speed with the bloom of Internet, no matter the traditional media or the emerging social media all join this information revolution in past 20 years; Meanwhile, the data science started to join this revolution in recent years. With the more and more data involved into the journalism, there is new upgrade journalism appears: the Data-Driven Journalism. The journalism content revolution start from the text-only, then, the text with pictures, finally, the text with data visualization. The FiveThirtyEight is a good representative of them. Many articles from FiveThirtyEight suggested from the data, then the editors use all kinds of visualization tools try to show the best interpret of the news to the audiences.    

Unfortunately, there is no evidence shows all kinds of the visualization suit to the explain of data and news, especially for the visualization interactivity, there are many articles in data journalism carried fancy interactivity, but there may only have less readers did the interactive with the visualization [1].   

In this paper, we collected all the visualization interactivity approach, organized and analysis them. Then we designed a multivariate test which use the same article from novel media with different visual interactivity to evaluate the effectiveness of different visual interactivity methods.
